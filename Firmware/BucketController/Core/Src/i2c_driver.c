  * @brief Polls the MCP23017 GPIO expanders at a fixed rate and provides the CV streams
  *        to MCP4728 DACs at a fixed rate.
  *
  * The bucket controller has four identical I2C busses, one for each channel it controls.
  * Each of these I2C busses contains 3 MCP23017s (0x20, 0x21, 0x22) and 5 MCP4728s
  * (0x60, 0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x64). The first two MCP23017s are connected to the rotation pins
  * of the rotary encoders on their respective channel are polled at a higher rate (1,500 times/sec)
  * than the third one (only 100 times/sec), which is only connected to push buttons.
  * The MCP4728s are fed a 12-bit, low speed 600Hz sample rate stream and provide 20 control
  * voltage DAC channels per console channel. I2C busses run at fast rate (400kHz).
